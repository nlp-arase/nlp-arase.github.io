## How to edit Member
Member data is in `_data/professors.json` or `_data/students.json`

We can view the same sequence of json data, so you edit the json data carefully.


json data has three features. Following features must be fulled.

 - `name` : member's name
 - `grade` : member's grade or status
 - `message` : message

## TODO
 - Add the English page
 - (Add the icon or picture in member page?)
